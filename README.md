# MPI-as-a-Launching-Method
This repository is about showing the results of performance characterization of different MPI implementations as a launching method     


To launch multiple MPI jobs simultaneously, we used the Dynamic Process Management characteristic of the various MPI implementations. The key aspect of this MPI feature is that, it gives an MPI process the ability to participate in the creation of new MPI processes or to establish communication with MPI processes that have been started separately. Dynamic process management was introduced in the MPI-2 standard, and its specification describes three main interfaces by which MPI processes can dynamically establish communications: MPI_Comm_spawn, MPI_Comm_accept/MPI_Comm_connect and MPI_Comm_join. The MPI_Comm_spawn interface allows an MPI process to spawn a number of instances of the named MPI process. The newly spawned set of MPI processes form a new MPI_COMM_WORLD intracommunicator, but can communicate with the parent with the intercommunicator which the function returns. MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple is an alternate interface that allows the different instances spawned to be different binaries with different arguments.
